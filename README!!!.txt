Welcome to Ludo

To start the game you will choose either to choose a new game or join an existing game.
After you setup your lobby you can start.
Each player takes turns rolling the dice.

In order to move your piece from the starting location you must roll a 6.
After the 6 is rolled you have the ability to roll once more.
You click the piece you want to move and the piece will move to the location automatically.
The goal of the game is to get all pieces to the end point before the other players.
Landing on another player sends them back to their base.

Enjoy!


Importing into Intelij:

1. on welcome screen drag src\game\Ludo.java into the window 
and the project should open up, this is also the Main file for starting the application

2. You might get a message at the top right saying to setup sdk, click this and choose any jdk version 
you have installed. I compiled it with JDK8 so you might need to build it again after you select the SDK

Other run option (Jar):

in terminal cd to \out\artifacts\ludo

java -jar ludo.jar
