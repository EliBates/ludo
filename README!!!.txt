Importing into Intelij:

1. on welcome screen drag src\game\Ludo.java into the window 
and the project should open up, this is also the Main file for starting the application

2. You might get a message at the top right saying to setup sdk, click this and choose any jdk version 
you have installed. I compiled it with JDK8 so you might need to build it again after you select the SDK

Other run option (Jar):

in terminal cd to \out\artifacts\ludo

java -jar ludo.jar
